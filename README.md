# Temperature-controlled-DC-fan
A Temperature Controlled DC Fan is a system which automatically turns on a DC Fan when the ambient temperature increases above a certain limit.

Generally,
electronic devices produce more heat. So this heat should be
reduced in order to protect the device.
so this project can be used in this scenario

The key component of this temperature
controlled fan circuit is Thermistor, which has been used to
detect the rise in temperature. Thermistor is temperature
sensitive resistor, whose resistance changes according to the
temperature

Advantages
• Easy to handle and economical
• Fan starts automatically, so it can control the temperature manually.
• Automatic switching will save the energy.
• For cooling heat dissipating devices, installation is easy

Applications of Temperature Controlled DC Fan
• Cooling fans for laptops and computers.
• This device is used for cooling the car engine. 

Conclusion
 The Temperature controlled DC fan using LM 741 is a very
useful tool used in various computers and are very used in most electronic devices
